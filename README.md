HW 20 (supervised learning) for Data Science Bootcamp



In this challenge I referenced a dataset of historical lending activity from a lending company and built model that cn indentify the creditworthiness of borrowers. 


This code performs a classification analysis to predict loan status (healthy or high-risk) using various machine learning models. The main steps include: Data Preprocessing, Model Training and Evaluation, Performance Metric generation, Feature Importance analysis. 

In summary, the code builds, trains, and evaluates several models to predict loan status, with a focus on performance comparison across models.
